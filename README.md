# Singapore-Bus-and-Train-Heat-Map
This project aims to create a graphical representation of bus stops and train stations over Singapore, coupled with a heat map showing real-time and historical arrival times. The project will be developed from scratch, minimizing reliance on external dependencies, frameworks, or libraries.
